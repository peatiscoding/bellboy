# bellboy

Highly performant JavaScript data stream ETL engine.

Forked from (Claviz/bellboy) for personal uses. Please visit [original author](https://github.com/Claviz/bellboy) for official documents and complete functions.

## What I did?

Due to my project requirement, I need to remove `mqtt`, `mssql`, `pg` and `request` related lib. To make the bellboy as slim as possible.
